# JS NOTES
Javascript is the functional language!  Where HTML and CSS are focused on content, structure, and style, Javascript allows you to program dynamic and responsive blocks of code.

## syntax basics:

- The <script> tag uses Javascript inside an HTML document.
- Best way would be to create a JS document and link it to your index.html, just like with your CSS style sheet
- Javascript is the language that makes a webpage more interactive
