# Computer Architecture

At their core, computers are machines that multiply the force of the mind, the same way a bicycle enhances the muscles of the body.
All computers are defined by 4 core functions they can perform:


- Input/Devices – Take in information (bits) into binary information

- Storage/Memory– Store that information.

- Processing /CPU– Process that info, send back to memory and process continues until ready for output.

- Output/Devices - Results , depending on what the computer is designed to do.
