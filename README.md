# THIS IS CODE I AM CODING I AM A GENIUS
* this is a list of nouns I have coded into a list
* banana
* typewriter
* hamburger
*i think this line is invisible*
## IT TURNS OUT IT IS NOT INVISIBLE IT IS JUST ITALICIZED FOR SOME REASON.  WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I PRESS 'BLAME'

1. It shows you a list of changes made to the file and who entered it and when
2. YOU CAN'T HIDE ANYTHING I WILL FIND YOU AND BLAME YOU

######THIS SENTENCE HAS 6 HASHTAGS IN FRONT OF IT

3. I PUT ANOTHER STAR AND NOW THE INVISIBLE LINE HAS DOUBLED AND IS GREEN AND RED
1. I'M
1. GOING
1. TO
1. TRY
1. THE 1 1 1 LIST TRICK

#the invisible line is no longer green and red I think it was just showing that way because oh wait Ryan just said it's a preview and the red is what it was, green is the new update that makes sense dope.

###### this sentence also has 6 hashtags in front of it, did the other one not work because it's in the middle of a list?

# Growth Mindset:
## What it means to me
A growth mindset is one that embraces failure, learns through constant play, and experiments through trial and error.

GROWTH MINDSET DOS AND DON'TS:
- [x] keep a good attitude
- [x] remember to have fun
- [x] race it, break it, fix 
- [ ] be super negative 
- [x] you are smart enough to do this!
- [x] there are so many people who want to help you and see you succeed!
- [ ] you will never understand this you should just stick to sales
