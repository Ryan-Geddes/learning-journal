### Lessons learned for 201:
- prereading and being familiar with the concepts BEFORE class starts is hugely helpful
- take notetaking more seriously!
- do not fall behind on the reading notetaking submission requirements, it is a pain to get caught back up
- you WILL need to budget time outside of class to research concepts, finish labs, and practice

This is a second test of adding/committing/pushing code to GITHUB.

This is a third test.
