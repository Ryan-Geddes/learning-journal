### Lessons learned for 201:
- prereading and being familiar with the concepts BEFORE class starts is hugely helpful
- take notetaking more seriously!
- do not fall behind on the reading notetaking submission requirements, it is a pain to get caught back up
- you WILL need to budget time outside of class to research concepts, finish labs, and practice

# Growth Mindset:
## What it means to me
A growth mindset is one that embraces failure, learns through constant play, and experiments through trial and error.

GROWTH MINDSET DOS AND DON'TS:
- [x] keep a good attitude
- [x] remember to have fun
- [x] race it, break it, fix 
- [ ] be super negative 
- [x] you are smart enough to do this!
- [x] there are so many people who want to help you and see you succeed!
- [ ] you will never understand this you should just stick to sales

This is a test of writing code on my laptop and pushing it to GITHUB.  This code was written in vscode.

This is a second test of adding/committing/pushing code to GITHUB.

This is a third test.
